## Introduction
This attendance extension when integrated with online classes(Ex. Google meet) determines whether the student is present or absent by continuously monitoring the joined and left time of the student. This ultimately prevents teachers from manually taking or downloading the attendance and checking for roll numbers.

## About the project
It calculates the maximum time spent by the student in the meeting from his/her activities(joining and leaving) and determines whether he/she is present or absent by checking the time spent with the minimum time provided by the teacher.
A web application is also developed to maintain the attendance record with minimum report. It will contain information like percentage of attendance, date and state of attendance for each class.
